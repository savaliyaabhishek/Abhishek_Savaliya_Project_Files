Implemented Required features:
  -Bubbles now have parabolic motion with verticle velocity. They bounce off when collides with upper or lower surface.
  -Collision between bubble and shooter will decrease health by 1 and shoot will become red after collision for some time.Also when shooter is red it can't move or shoot.
  -Collision between bubble and bullet will increase score by 1 and split big bubble in 2 smaller bubbles of half radius.While collision will make small bubbles disappear. 
  -Bullet also disappears when it collides with any bubble.
  -Game ends when all bubbles are eliminated.

Implemented extra features:
  -Large bubbles split into smaller ones of half radius after collision. 
  -These two smaller bubbles will move in opposite horizontal direction. While they both will have same vertical velocity as their parent big bubble. 
  -There is a timer. When time reaches 50, game will be over.
  -Total health provided is 3. Each collision between bubble and shooter will reduce health by 1. When health becomes 0 it's game over.
  -There is a score counter which records score. Score increases when collision occurs between bubble and bullet.

NOTE:Since we had to add at least 2 out of 3 extra features, I have not added third extra feature of different levels of the game.
